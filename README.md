<p>Our vision is the creation of an online platform where stundents can register and attend lectures.</p>

## Main site

<p>The site offers to select course categories, learn about the creators of the site and contact us with comments or suggestions.</p>

## Categories of lectures

<p>So far, we have three groups of Lectures: Programming, Economics and Sciences, each of them with three separate groups of courses. </p>

## Information about every subject

<p>Each course has a name, a link that takes the user to another website to get more information and a short description. For the lecture, the student can know the hours per week, cost, lecture duration in months and content.</p>
